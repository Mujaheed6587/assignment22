# Lesson: Introduction to HTML

## 1. Why HTML?
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the **foundation of the web**.  
- It is not a programming language but a **markup language** used to **structure content** on the internet.  
- Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of every webpage â€” it gives meaning and organization to content.  

> ðŸ’¡ Analogy: If the web were a house, HTML is the walls, CSS is the paint, and JavaScript is the electricity.

## 2. HTML as a Document Formatting Tool
- HTML was designed to **format documents** for transfer over the Internet.  
- It uses **tags** to tell the browser how to display content.  
- Tags come in pairs: **opening tag** `<p>` and **closing tag** `</p>`.
